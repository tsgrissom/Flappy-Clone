# Flappy-Clone

A poorly-illustrated, experimental clone of Flappy Bird for iOS devices. Designed with iPhone/iPad adaptivity in mind using a combination of SpriteKit and SwiftUI.

This project marked a few firsts for me, including being:

* Not only an Apple app utilizing frameworks beyond SwiftUI, but combined SwiftUI with earlier Apple frameworks
* Using SpriteKit to create interactive, physically-simulated sprites and simple gameplay loops
* Experience how screen adaptivity could be achieved for non-SwiftUI elements
* A way to get hands-on while learning the difference between declarative and imperative programming

Programmer's art created using the wonderful Procreate.
